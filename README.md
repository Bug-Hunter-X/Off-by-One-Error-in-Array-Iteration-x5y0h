This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution involves adjusting the loop condition to correctly iterate within the array bounds.
